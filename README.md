This is a electron.js project that analyzes pdf documents words and gives frequency of words' use. Also allows you to save results in a excel file on the same directory of given file.

# Build and Installation

## Installation

[Download Windows Installer](https://www.mediafire.com/file/woau8l6hs0ct6vw/WordAnalyzerSetup.exe/file)

Not builded for Linux or Mac and setup probably only works on Windows 10 and above because of Inno compiler.

## Build and Contrubuting

Fork the repo than you can open a pull request and you can write me from discord if you need help.

After you made your changes you can use `npm run dev` to try and you can use `npm run build` to build a exe file.

* It would be nice you to help me to add `docx` files. My first goal was accept docx and pdf files but reader libraries burned me.
